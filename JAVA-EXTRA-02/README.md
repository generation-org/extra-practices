# JAVA-Extra-02 - Brick Breaker Game

 <br/>

## Exercise

In this assessment, you're going to build a brick breaker game.

Maybe if you're not old enough to have played computer games in the 2000s, you won't remember what this game is. So here goes a picture of what it looks like:

 <br/>
 <br/>

And this is how the game is played:

* In the beginning, all the bricks are aligned at the top of the screen. And there is a tiny ball at a platform at the bottom of the screen.
* The player controls the platform with the help of the arrow keys on the keyboard. And they use it to keep the ball running.
* The goal is to break the bricks in the top of the screen without letting the ball fall from the platform in the bottom.
* For each brick broken, the player makes one point.
* The game ends when the player breaks all the bricks (game won) or when the player lets the ball fall from the platform (game over).


Write your code in Java that reproduces the described game.
