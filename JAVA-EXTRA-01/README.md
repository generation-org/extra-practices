# JAVA-Extra-01 - Number Guessing Game

 <br/>

## Exercise

You will create a game that allows the user to guess the random number generated by the computer.

The game involves the following steps:

1. The system generates a random number from 1 to 100.
2. The computer prompts a dialogue box to the user to insert a number.
4. The computer then tells if the entered number matches the guesses number. If not, it indicates if it is higher/lower than the generated number.
5. The game continues under the user guessing the number.

Write your code in Java, that reproduce the game steps.

#### Keep practicing - OPTIONAL

If you want to add more challenge to your assessment, you can incorporate these further details:

* Limiting the number of attempts.
* Adding more rounds.
* Displaying score.
* Giving points based on the number of attempts.

Those details won't be evaluated as part of the assessment. It is optional, and you can add them only if you want to keep practicing.
