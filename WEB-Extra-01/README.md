# WEB-Extra-01 - Portfolio Website

 <br/>

## Exercise

You will create a Portfolio Website, with the following features: 

* Your portifolio should have a welcome section with an id of *welcome_section*.
* The welcome section should have an *h1* element that contains text.
* Your portfolio should have a projects section with an id of *projects*.
* The projects section should contain at least one element with a class of *project-tile* to hold a project.
* The projects section should contain at least one link to a project.
* Your portfolio should have a navbar with an id of *navbar*.
* The navbar should contain at least one link that I can click on to navigate to different sections of the page.
* Your portfolio should have a link with an id of *profile-link*, which opens my GitHub or FCC profile in a new tab.
* Your portfolio should have at least one media query.
* The height of the welcome section should be equal to the height of the viewport.
* The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.

You can use HTML and CSS to complete this project. You can follow [this example](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNBOYG) to build your portfolio. Or unleash your creativity to make a completely different website that contains the features above.
