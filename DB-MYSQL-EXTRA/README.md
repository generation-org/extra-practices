## Exercise

* Add some data to the tables that you created - you’re going to need it in the next part. Add at least two categories, five recipes, and five ratings. But feel free to add more data if you want to.


### Querying the data

Create queries to answer the following questions:
1. When was the last recipe evaluation?
2. Which is the recipe with the highest average rate in the portal?
3. How many recipes are registered by category?
4. How many recipes were created by month this year?
